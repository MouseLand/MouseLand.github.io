Our lab is at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/) (near DC), a fully-funded non-profit research institution. Janelia just received a $500 million investment for AI research ðŸ¤–, more info [here](https://ai.hhmi.org/). 

We are recruiting [postdocs](positions.qmd)!

## Research

Our lab combines machine learning / AI techniques and large-scale imaging to investigate plasticity rules and sensory representations in cortical circuits. Example recording of 50,000+ neurons simultaneously at 3Hz, using two-photon calcium imaging:

Learn more about our research [here](research/index.qmd) and see all publications [here](research/publications.qmd). We share all the data generated by our studies, linked [here](code_and_data.qmd). We also have developed several data processing packages for the bio/neuro community: [cellpose](research/posts/cellpose.qmd), [kilosort](research/posts/kilosort.qmd), [suite2p](research/posts/suite2p.qmd), [facemap](research/posts/rastermap.qmd), and [rastermap](research/posts/rastermap.qmd).
