## Postdocs

We are seeking [postdocs](hhttps://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/postdoctoral-scientists) to investigate how large populations of neurons perform complex computations. We collect and analyze recordings of 50,000+ neurons, developing machine learning tools to extract computational principles from these large-scale datasets. Please reach out to Carsen Stringer (<stringerc@hhmi.org>) with your CV if you are interested. We are looking for candidates with experience performing imaging experiments in animals and ideally some experience analyzing large-scale neural datasets. Please share a link to your github profile on your CV when applying, especially if you are coming from a computational background.

All research is internally funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute with highly competitive benefits. A first-year postdoc is compensated at a rate of $74,200.00 annually.
